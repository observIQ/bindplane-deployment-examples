# Bindplane Deployment Example – Specification

## 1. Overview

This repository provides reference templates and documentation for deploying Bindplane in various environments. It aims to help customers (and internal teams) quickly spin up a highly available Bindplane deployment alongside its required dependencies (PostgreSQL, Prometheus, etc.).

### Key goals:

- Centralize example deployments: Terraform, Docker Compose, and possibly other IaC or environment-specific examples.
- Reference an external Helm chart repository (the "official" Bindplane Helm chart).
- Provide clear, versioned documentation for each deployment option.

## 2. Repository Structure

A suggested directory layout could look like this:

```
bindplane-deployment-example/
├── README.md
├── docs/
│ ├── overview.md
│ ├── helm-quickstart.md
│ ├── terraform-gcp-guide.md
│ ├── docker-compose-guide.md
│ └── ...
├── docker-compose/
│ └── docker-compose.yaml
├── terraform/
│ ├── gcp/
│ │ ├── main.tf
│ │ ├── variables.tf
│ │ ├── outputs.tf
│ │ └── README.md
│ └── (potentially other cloud or on-prem directories)
└── examples/
└── (any additional example configs or advanced usage)
```

### High-Level Explanation

- **README.md**: Provides an overview of what's in this repo and links to subdirectories or docs.
- **docs/**: Contains more in-depth documentation for each deployment method, plus additional references (networking requirements, scaling tips, version pinning, etc.).
- **docker-compose/**: A minimal Compose file for quick local testing or single-host deployments (not for production HA).
- **terraform/**: Holds subdirectories for cloud-specific Terraform deployments (e.g., gcp/, aws/, azure/). Each subdirectory can have its own modules, README, and usage instructions.
- **examples/**: Additional advanced configuration examples (e.g., hooking up an external load balancer, using an existing Postgres instance, etc.).

## 3. Helm Chart Reference

Because the official Bindplane Helm chart is in its own repository ("bindplane-charts" or similar):

### Referenced in Documentation

- In docs/helm-quickstart.md, explain how to add your Helm repository (e.g., `helm repo add bindplane https://...`) and install the chart with `helm install bindplane/bindplane-chart ...`
- Provide example values.yaml or commands that reflect a recommended high-availability configuration (e.g., multiple replicas, external Postgres, etc.).

### Version Pinning

- In each example, specify the chart version that users should deploy.
- Example: `helm install bindplane bindplane/bindplane-chart --version 1.2.3`

### Documentation Cross-Links

- Link back to the official Helm chart docs for detailed configuration options (like all available .Values settings).

## 4. Terraform-Based Deployments

Under terraform/gcp/ (and optionally terraform/aws/, terraform/azure/, etc.), you can provide:

### main.tf:

- Provisions the underlying infrastructure (e.g., GKE cluster, VPC, subnets, firewall rules)
- Optionally creates a managed database (Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL on GCP)
- Optionally sets up a managed Prometheus or a cluster-based Prometheus
- (Optional) Uses the Terraform Helm provider to deploy the Bindplane chart automatically once the cluster is up

### variables.tf:

- Defines input variables (e.g., project ID, region, cluster name, chart version)

### outputs.tf:

- Exports important info (like the GKE endpoint, load balancer IP, database connection strings)

### README.md (within terraform/gcp):

Explains how to initialize and apply the Terraform configuration:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -var="project_id=xxx" -var="region=us-central1"
terraform apply -var="project_id=xxx" -var="region=us-central1"
```

Details any prerequisites (e.g., enabling GCP APIs, authenticating with gcloud)

### Security/Secrets Handling

- Document how environment variables or secret managers (e.g., GCP Secret Manager) are used to store credentials
- Encourage best practices (e.g., .gitignore any local .tfvars that might have sensitive data)

## 5. Docker Compose

The docker-compose/ directory can include:

### docker-compose.yaml:

- Defines a minimal set of services: bindplane, postgres, prometheus, etc.
- Note that it's typically for local development or testing only, not production HA

### Documentation:

Either inline in the docker-compose.yaml or in a docker-compose-guide.md:

- Show how to run `docker-compose up -d`
- Provide notes on environment variables (e.g., DB credentials), volumes, etc.
- Remind users that Docker Compose alone won't give them multi-node high availability

## 6. Documentation

### 6.1 Docs Directory

Inside docs/, maintain separate markdown files for each topic:

- **overview.md**: High-level explanation of what Bindplane is, the purpose of this repo, and a table of contents linking to detailed guides
- **helm-quickstart.md**: Step-by-step instructions for installing Bindplane on any existing Kubernetes cluster using your Helm chart
- **terraform-gcp-guide.md**: More detailed walk-through for GCP deployments. Includes prerequisites, example commands, and references to terraform/gcp/
- **docker-compose-guide.md**: Explains local testing with Docker Compose, environment variable configuration, etc.

### 6.2 Additional Topics

- HA considerations: Node sizing, recommended replica counts, etc.
- Security: TLS guidance, secrets management, firewall rules
- Scaling: Guidance for horizontal scaling of Bindplane workers, CPU/memory sizing, etc.

### 6.3 Cross-Linking

- Provide links to relevant official Bindplane docs (like advanced configuration or best practices)
- Link to the Helm chart's own documentation for a full list of Helm values

## 7. Example Usage Flows

### 7.1 Helm-Only

1. Create or use an existing K8s cluster
2. `helm repo add bindplane https://example.com/helm`
3. `helm install bindplane bindplane/bindplane-chart --version X.X.X -f my-values.yaml`

### 7.2 Terraform GCP

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to terraform/gcp/
3. Run `terraform init && terraform apply -var="project_id=..."`
4. Wait for the cluster and DB to provision
5. (If using the Terraform Helm provider) Confirm the Helm release is installed automatically. Otherwise, run your helm install command

### 7.3 Docker Compose

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to docker-compose/
3. `docker-compose up -d`
4. Access Bindplane on localhost:<mapped_port> to confirm everything is working

## 8. Versioning Strategy

- **Tagging**: Tag this repository with the same major/minor version as Bindplane or your Helm chart, e.g., v1.2.3
- **Changelog**: Maintain a simple changelog to note when you upgrade the Helm chart reference, update Terraform modules, or revise the Docker Compose file
- **Branches**: Optionally keep a development branch for new features, and merge into main (or master) for official releases

## 9. Next Steps and Maintenance

### Automated Testing (future enhancement):

- Consider setting up a CI pipeline that spins up a minimal environment (for Terraform or Docker Compose) to ensure templates remain valid
- Lint or test the Helm chart references to prevent breaking changes

### Community Contributions:

- Encourage customers or the community to submit pull requests if they create improved examples or fix issues

### Ongoing Updates:

- Whenever you release a new Bindplane version or update the Helm chart, ensure you revise the examples here accordingly
- Update docs for new features, config options, or best practices

## Conclusion

By following this spec, you'll provide a clear, well-documented repository that helps customers deploy Bindplane in multiple ways (Kubernetes/Helm, Terraform, Docker Compose). It keeps your official Helm chart in its own repository while centralizing sample IaC and container orchestrations in a single reference location. Over time, this repo can evolve to include more advanced examples, automation scripts, or additional cloud providers—always with the primary goal of helping users confidently stand up Bindplane in an HA configuration.
